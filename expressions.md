# Expressions

Before we dive into *expressions* in the context of programming, let us briefly take a tour to a more familiar concept. 

When you see the word *"manzanas"*, what comes to your mind? What about *"aeropuerto"* or *"hombre"* and lastly, *"viernes"*?

The Spaniard readers and Spanish language students like myself will easily map these words to their English counterparts as follows:

| Spanish | English |
|--------|---------|
| manzanas | apples |
| aeropuerto | aeroplane |
| hombre | man |
| viernes | friday |

The obvious reason why you aren't able to come up with a meaning is that no such combination of letters exist in your memory. The expression failed to translate to a meaningful value in your brain.

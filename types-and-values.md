# Types and Values

> Computer programs work by manipulating **values**, such as the number 3.14 or the text 'Hello World'. <br><br> The kinds of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language are known as **types**. <br><br>And one of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of types it supports. <br><br> David Flanagan, Javascript the definitive guide, seventh edition.

Every programming language has the set of types they support which then translates to the kinds of values it can accept to work on and manipulate. 

Before we continue, let's talk about a more familiar concept. 

In biology, animals can be classified as herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores. For the non-biology students, **herbivores** are all animals that eat plants products, **carnivores** are those that eat other animals, while **omnivores** are those that eat both.

What makes these *animal* differ in the *type* of food they eat? It is simply the type of *digestive system* they possess. For instance, animals that eat plant directly possess an enzyme called cellulase, which aids the digestion of cellulose. Most carnivores eat their food raw, sucking the blood as well, because they have an iron filtering digestive system, since humans lacks such iron filtering digestive system, our food must be rinsed and cooked properly before eating. It is clear now that each animal have the *types* of food they eat. Because eating just any type of food may result to death of the animal, every animal are careful in the type of food they take in. Have you ever eaten a log of plywood before? Certainly no, and that's the favorite food of termites.

So also, each programming language (such as Python, Ruby, Perls, Java, C# etc.) has the types of values (food) they can work on (eat). Simple. So let's talk about the types of values JavaScript can *"eat"*. 

The two fundamental types in JavaScript are 

- **primitive types**
- **reference types**

Don't let the terms scare you, they are just like saying *carbohydrate* and *protein*. When you see carbohydrate, you think rice, and when you see proteins, you think meat, so when you see *primitives* think the following

- *Numbers*
- *Strings*
- *Booleans*
- *null*
- *undefined*
- *symbols* and
- *Bigint*

so also, when you see *reference*, think

- *objects*
- *arrays*
- *maps* and
- *sets*

The fundamental difference between these two types is *immutability*. Primitives are immutable, while reference types are mutable.
